# Food Image Recognition using Deep Learning

The project helps you classify food images using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Getting Started

The project essentially has two types of code:
  1.  **build-model.py** trains a DCNN model using your training data and freezes it to be used in the android code.
  2.  **android_app/SnapSnack** is the full code for an android application that recognizes the food item when the user either clicks an image or uploads one.
  
  For just building the model and command-line testing, **build-model.py** should be enough
